# Biography
Hi &#129303;! I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I currently work closely with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/) as an intern at Shanghai AI Lab. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in June 2023. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to do research with some talented people in [APEX Lab](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/).

# Research Interests
My goal is to develop an intelligent decision-making system that possesses optimality, generalizability, interpretability and robustness. To achieve this, I primarily focus on &#129300;:
* Generalist Reinforcement Learning and its application in the real world.
* Scalability and sample efficiency in Reinforcement Learning.
* Effective planning with Large Language Models (LLMs).
